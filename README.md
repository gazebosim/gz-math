# Features

Ignition Math provides a wide range of functionality, including:

* Type-templated pose, matrix, vector, and quaternion classes.
* Shape representations along with operators to compute volume, density, size and other properties.
* Classes for material properties, mass, inertial, temperature, [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller), kmeans, spherical coordinates, and filtering.
* Optional Eigen component that converts between a few Eigen and Ignition
Math types.

# Install

We recommend following the [Binary Install](#markdown-header-binary-install) instructions to get up and running as quickly and painlessly as possible.

The [Source Install](#markdown-header-source-install) instructions should be used if you need the very latest software improvements, you need to modify the code, or you plan to make a contribution.

## Binary Install

On Ubuntu systems, `apt-get` can be used to install `ignition-math`:

```
sudo apt install libignition-math<#>-dev
```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
which version you need.

## Source Install

Source installation can be performed in UNIX systems by first installing the
necessary prerequisites followed by building from source.

### Prerequisites

The optional Eigen component of Ignition Math requires:

  * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). Refer to the [Eigen Documentation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Documentation) for installation instructions. On Ubuntu systems, `apt-get` can be used to install Eigen:

    ```
    sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
    ```

### Building from source

1. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-math
    ```

2. Configure and build

    ```
    cd ign-math; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
    ```

3. Optionally, install Ignition Math

    ```
    sudo make install
    ```

# Usage

Please refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-math/raw/master/examples/).

# Documentation

API and tutorials can be found at [https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/math](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/math).

You can also generate the documentation from a clone of this repository by following these steps.

1. You will need Doxygen. On Ubuntu Doxygen can be installed using

    ```
    sudo apt-get install doxygen
    ```

2. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-math
    ```

3. Configure and build the documentation.

    ```
    cd ign-math; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../; make doc
    ```

4. View the documentation by running the following command from the build directory.

    ```
    firefox doxygen/html/index.html
    ```

# Testing

Follow these steps to run tests and static code analysis in your clone of this repository.

1. Follow the [source install instruction](#markdown-header-source-install).

2. Run tests.

    ```
    make test
    ```

3. Static code checker.

    ```
    make codecheck
    ```
