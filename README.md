# Features

Gazebo Math provides a wide range of functionality, including:

* Type-templated pose, matrix, vector, and quaternion classes.
* Shape representations along with operators to compute volume, density, size and other properties.
* Classes for material properties, mass, inertial, temperature, [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller), kmeans, spherical coordinates, and filtering.
* Optional Eigen component that converts between a few Eigen and Gazebo
Math types.

# Install

See the [installation tutorial](https://gazebosim.org/api/math/6.8/install.html).

# Usage

Please refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-math/raw/ign-math6/examples/).
